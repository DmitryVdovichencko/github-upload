   <h1>VanillaJS 30 days coding challenge</h1>
  <p class="preview__content">

This is repository for 30 days vanillaJS coding challenge. It's created for practical free JavaScript course from Wes Bos. So, when I join to this course, I've started my 30 days coding challenge.

For me it works like this:

    Just watch - what, we have to create. rocket
    Start from designinig simple web page, using HTML & CSS3, check that all looks fine and go ahead to JS part smiling_imp
    Make JS code for this small app. No frameworks, no libraries, just Vanilla JS. If I stuck on some problems, ghost I look at learn.javascript and other places like MDN, w3schools and so on. If it doesn't work I'll watch video from course to figure out. muscle
    When web page is done and everything looks fine +1, I can look at my JS code and think about, how I can make it better 

Also after first two coding challenges I've decided to create pretty nice frontpage with this projects. Hopefully, it looks fine </p>
